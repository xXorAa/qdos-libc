Changes by Thierry Godefroy:

12/11/00:	changed "char type" parameter to "unsigned char type" into
		_fstat.c SimpleTypeToModeT() and BlockTypeToModeT() functions
		as gcc does not like to compare a signed char with a signed
		value in "switch ... case" construct (bug reported by
		Jonathan Hudson).
