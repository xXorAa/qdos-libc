Changes by Thierry Godefroy:

22/09/00:	Changed the extension separator from "_" to "." into
		the #include directives.

13/10/00:	Changed the thingtrap code so that the thing utility vector is
		always used when present (the TRAP code is only tried when no
		utility vector is found): this cures the problems encountered
		with some badly written things that don't like the sms_*()
		functions to enter supervisor mode and also prevents problems
		with some buggy SMSQ/E versions where the TRAP thing code had
		problems...
		More sanity check is also made on the thing utility vector.

12/11/00:	changed "auto char key" to "auto unsigned char key" into
		conqpac.c consetup_qpac_poll() function	as gcc does not like to
		compare a signed char with a signed value in "switch ... case"
		construct.
